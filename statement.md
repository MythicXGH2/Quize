# Project Statement – Python Quiz Master

## Project Title
**Python Quiz Master – An Interactive Terminal-Based Quiz Game with Timer & Leaderboard**

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, students need **fun & quick ways** to test their knowledge in General Knowledge, Programming, and Computer Science.  
Traditional quizzes are boring, have no time pressure, no instant feedback, and no way to track progress over time.

**There is a clear need for a lightweight, engaging, and educational quiz app** that motivates users to learn through gamification!

This project solves exactly that with a colorful, timer-based quiz game built purely in Python.

## Objective
To develop a **fun, interactive, terminal-based quiz application** in Python that:
- Tests knowledge with time-bound questions
- Gives instant feedback
- Tracks performance via a leaderboard
- Encourages repeated practice

## Scope of the Project

### In-Scope (Successfully Implemented)
- 3 exciting categories (General Knowledge, Python Programming, Computer Science)
- 5 random questions per round
- 10-second timer per question
- Beautiful colorful interface
- Persistent leaderboard with name, score, date & time
- Fully menu-driven system
- Works on Windows, Linux & macOS

### Out-of-Scope (Future Enhancements)
- GUI using Tkinter/PyQt
- Web version or online multiplayer
- User login system
- SQLite/MySQL database
- Sound effects
