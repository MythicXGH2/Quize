# Project Statement – Python Quiz Master

## Project Title
**Python Quiz Master – An Interactive Terminal-Based Quiz Game with Timer and Leaderboard**

## Problem Statement
In todays fast-paced learning environment, students and beginners often need an engaging and quick way to test their knowledge in subjects like General Knowledge, Programming, and Computer Science fundamentals. Traditional pen-and-paper quizzes or static question banks lack interactivity, real-time feedback, and performance tracking.

There is a need for a lightweight, fun, and educational quiz application that:
- Challenges users with time-bound questions
- Provides instant feedback
- Tracks and displays past performance
- Encourages repeated practice through gamification

This project solves these issues by delivering a fully functional, colorful, and user-friendly quiz system using only Python.

## Objective
To design and develop a **terminal-based interactive quiz game** in Python that tests the user’s knowledge across multiple domains, enforces a time limit per question, calculates scores, and maintains a persistent leaderboard.

## Scope of the Project
This project is developed as a **1st Year Computer Science & Engineering Mini Project** and includes the following scope:

### In-Scope (Implemented)
- Three quiz categories: General Knowledge, Python Programming, Computer Science
- 5 random questions per session
- 10-second timer for each question
- Colorful and user-friendly console interface
- Score calculation and result display with motivational messages
- Persistent leaderboard using file handling (`quiz_leaderboard.txt`)
- Menu-driven system (Play Quiz / View Leaderboard / Exit)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### Out-of-Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Online multiplayer or web version
- User authentication system
- Database storage (currently uses text file)
- Sound effects and animations

## Target Users
This project is designed for:
- 1st & 2nd-year CSE/IT students preparing for basics
- School students (Class 8–12) for general knowledge practice
- Beginners learning Python or Computer Science fundamentals
- Teachers looking for a simple quiz tool for classroom use
- Anyone who enjoys fun, educational terminal games
